# Logitheism
Logitheism is a TOE GUT with the "Ethan Light Cube identity" for YM mass gap and almost all of physics

Quantum computing demonstration Geodeisc implications for computing, look at the proof file for gates.

State representation
We represent any “quantum” state (plus extra W/B branches if you like) as an 8-vector
X = [f₀,f₁,f₂,f₃, φ₀,φ₁,φ₂,φ₃]
and define
W(X) = f₀²e^{2iφ₀} + f₁²e^{2iφ₁} + f₂²e^{2iφ₂} + f₃²e^{2iφ₃}.

Initial equilibrium
The canonical start X₀ has fₖ=¼ and φₖ=k·π/2. One checks by direct substitution that W(X₀)=0.

Projection enforces W=0 exactly
We define
project_extended(X)
to be
X′ = X – Jᵀ·(J Jᵀ)⁻¹ ·[Re W(X), Im W(X)]ᵀ
where J is the 2×8 Jacobian of [Re W, Im W] w.r.t. X.

By construction this single Newton‐step update makes
Re W(X′)=0 and Im W(X′)=0
exactly (up to floating‐point rounding).

Therefore for any input X,
W(project_extended(X))=0.

Gates are always followed by projection
Every gate application is implemented as
apply_gate_ext(X, gate_fn)
which computes
Y = gate_fn(X)
then returns
project_extended(Y).

Induction: all states stay on W=0

Base case: X₀ satisfies W(X₀)=0.

Inductive step: assume current state Xₙ has W(Xₙ)=0. After one more gate, we compute
Xₙ₊₁ = apply_gate_ext(Xₙ, gate_fn).
By step 3 we know W(Xₙ₊₁)=0.

One thing to bear in mind is that this single Newton‐step projection only cancels the first-order part of the error in enforcing W=0. Because W depends nonlinearly on the amplitudes and phases, one step will typically leave a small residual (of order the square of the original violation). In practice you must either repeat the Newton step until the residual is below your tolerance or use a closed-form phase adjustment if you need to hit W=0 exactly in one shot.
Let
  δ = Jᵀ · (J Jᵀ)⁻¹ · [Re W(X), Im W(X)]ᵀ
and
  X′ = X – δ.

Then a Taylor expansion of W around X gives

  W(X′)
    = W(X) – J·δ + ½·δᵀ·H·δ + higher‐order terms
    = 0     + ½·δᵀ·H·δ + … 
    = O( W(X)² ).
